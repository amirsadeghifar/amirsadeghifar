# Hi there 👋, I'm Amir! 

I'm a Software Engineer based in Miami, FL 🏙

### 🚀 Splinter App 

I created [Splinter](https://splinter-app.github.io/) which is an open-source ingestion pipeline designed to transform unstructured data into vectorized formats for integration with knowledge bases and AI workflows. By automating document ingestion and vector embedding, Splinter enables teams to easily convert raw, unstructured content into a format optimized for AI and machine learning applications.
